I am following up on the below quote - are these works still pending?
As the quote is now beyond its 30 day validity period, if you do wish
to go ahead then please let us know, and we will advise if any costs
have changed.



The below quote is due to expire soon, so we may need to requote to
allow for changes in our costs for materials etc.  If you would like
to proceed with these works, then please let us know.
