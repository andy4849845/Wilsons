Suggested bullet journal type method:

Indented notes, up to 2 levels

<N> - new item

<i> - further info for an item (this would be 2nd level indent)

<1> - item yet to be started

<2>,<3>,<etc.> - ongoing item, number basically counting how many lists it's appeared in so far

<C> - completed since last time list was run

items disappear after that

Command?

note <i lab> - adds further info to note 'lab'
note <c lab> - mark 'lab' as completed
note - add new note
